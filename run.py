    Welcome to a thrilling game of Battleship with a twist! In this version,
    the playing field features only 1x1 ships, creating an intense and strategic challenge.
    Your task is to outsmart your opponent and sink their tiny, elusive ships while protecting your own.
    Precision and tactics are the name of the game in this compact naval battle. Are you ready to test
    your skills and emerge victorious in this micro-sized maritime showdown?

    What the symbols mean:
    路  = Symbolizes that this coordinate haven't been shot at
    X  = Symbolizes that a ship has been struck
    M  = Symbolizes that you missed and hit nothing.
    0  = Symbolizes where your ships are located at

    How to play:
    1. Whenever you feel you want to play a new game, restart the current one or have just finished playing press the
    big button called "Run Program".
    2. Type in the terminal how large you want your square grid to be. If you type 6, it will produce a 6x6 grid
    3. Type in how many ships you want to play with. These ships will be scattered around the grid randomly
    4. You are now presented with 2 different game boards. The one on top is where your ships are located, and keeps
    track where the computer has aimed their shots,and the bottom one is the grid for the computer and keeps track where
    you have aimed your shots.
    5. Type in the terminal what row you want to aim at and afterwards what column. E.g Type in 1 in row, and later 3 in
    column to shot at the 1,3 coordinate.
    6. You will be presented with eiter an X - which means you have hit a ship, or M - which symbolizes that you missed.
    7. The aim of the game is to sink every ship of your opponent.
    8. And the most important: To have fun!
