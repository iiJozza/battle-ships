# Battleship Game Readme
    Welcome to a thrilling game of Battleship with a twist! In this version,
    the playing field features only 1x1 ships, creating an intense and
    strategic challenge.

## How to Play
Battleship is a classic two-player strategy game where the goal is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours. The game is typically played on a grid, and each player has a set number of ships to place on their grid. In this itteration you play against a computer with an army of 1x1 ships.

### Setup: 
The grids are usually square and can vary in size, but a common grid size is 9x9. In this implementation, you can choose both the size of the grid, up to 9x9 and the amount of ships. The ship are randomly distributed around the grid.

### Scoring:
The game uses a hit/miss system for scoring. Each turn the player guesses a coordiante on where they think a ship might be, hoping to hit the opposing players ship. The player and computer alternate taking turns until someone sinks all of the others ship(s)."

### Winning the Game
The game continues until one player has sunk all of their opponent's ships. In the traditional game, a ship is considered "sunk" when every part of the ship has been hit.
